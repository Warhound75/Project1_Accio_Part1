# Accio File Transfer

## Overview

Accio File Transfer is a Python-based client-server application that facilitates file transfer over a TCP connection. This project is designed to help you learn about BSD sockets, network operations, and error handling. The project consists of a client (`client.py`) and a server (not included here) component.

## Environment Setup

To set up the development environment and work on this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aa-fiu-classes/cnt4713-project1 ~/cnt4713-proj1
cd ~/cnt4713-proj1
```

2. Initialize the virtual machine:

```bash
vagrant up
```

3. Access the virtual machine via SSH:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

4. Your project files in `~/cnt4713-proj1` on the host machine will be synchronized with `/vagrant` on the virtual machine. You can compile your code there.

## Client Application Specification

The client application (`client.py`) is responsible for connecting to a server, receiving specific commands, confirming them, and transferring a specified file. Below are the requirements for the client:

- Accept three command-line arguments: `<hostname>` (or IP address of the server to connect), `<port>` (port number of the server), and `<filename>` (name of the file to transfer to the server).
- Connect to the specified server and port.
- Receive two "accio\r\n" commands from the server.
- Send the correct confirmations to the server.
- Transfer the specified file to the server.
- Gracefully terminate the connection.

## Error Handling and Timeouts

- Handle incorrect hostname and port number gracefully, printing error messages to standard error (stderr) and exiting with a non-zero exit code.
- Implement timeout mechanisms for various scenarios, such as connecting to the server, receiving commands, and sending data. If a timeout occurs, print an error message to stderr and exit with a non-zero code.

## Usage

To run the client application, use the following command format:

```bash
python3 client.py <hostname> <port> <filename>
```

Example:

```bash
python3 client.py localhost 5000 file.txt
```
